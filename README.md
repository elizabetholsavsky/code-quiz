Game URL:

Click on the link above to go to the start page. Directions read:

"Put your JavaScript knowledge to the test. Time is limited but choose carefully... Wrong answers will deduct time from the clock!"

Click the "start" button to begin the game and start the timer. Read the question and select the best choice by clicking on the answer button.

If the choice is correct, you will earn a point (recorded at the top of the page) and go the next question.

If the choice is incorrect, you will lose 5 seconds from the clock and go to the next question without earning any additional points.

The game ends once all questions are answered or the clock reaches "0".

When the game is over, you are shown your final score and asked to type your initials into the input field. If you try to submit a blank form, than you will be alerted to enter your initials.

After clicking the "submit" button, the recent scores from local storage are displayed in the table. You have the option to play again by clicking the "play again" button.
