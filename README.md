"Put your JavaScript knowledge to the test. Time is limited but choose carefully... Wrong answers will deduct time from the clock!"

Click the "start" button to begin the game and start the timer. Read the question and select the best choice by clicking on the answer button.

If the choice is correct, you will earn a point (recorded at the top of the page) and go the next question.

After clicking the "submit" button, the recent scores from local storage are displayed in the table. You have the option to play again by clicking the "play again" button.
